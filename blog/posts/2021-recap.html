                <p>I think 2021 is a memorable year with everyone in the world. Many things happened in this year. Beside bad things, 2021 still a amazing year with me. </p>
<h3 id="aboutmyjob">About my job</h3>
<p>I started this year by quit my job where I had worked for three years. Main reason is I feel I have many problem with my knowlegde. I think I can go on with that knowledge but it also kick me fall in somedays. It's look like a sand castle and just one wave can destroy it easily. I really don't want to see that day. That's why I made a decision reset my career. I plan I will spend at least three months for improve my technical skill and my English (my Achilles heel). Beside knowledge, I also invested for other domain. I tried to play a simple song with piano, walk in a park every morning. After three months, I had got a some interview invite. Almost of them were interesting interviews. I had first English interviews which I had scared. After that, I join my current company. Honestly, that is a best company I worked. Everyone are nice. I learned many things in there. They don't give me a BIG thing like big projects, trending technology, luxury season gift box… They gift me knowledge which I was searching. How to write a good commit, how to write and review code, write a unit test… It really make me think "yeah, let forgot a sand castle! I have a tent, my real tent". Beside working time, after party time in here also good. Honestly, I hadn't feeling good in party time like that before. Thankful for everyone.</p>
<h3 id="aboutmyrelations">About my relations</h3>
<p>Just talk about my friends, 2021 is a hard year for our relation. Covid 19 was came and everything was disconnected. In that time, we didn't spent many time for chatted, just some words for check others situation. That is hard time but we still have a some memorable moment, watching Dota 2 TI and PGL Major together on Discord. Thank Lord, everyone are safe. Finally, we have meet and party together. When I was writting this recap, I was eating a cake from my friend.</p>
<h3 id="aboutotherthing">About other thing.</h3>
<p>About game, I spent many time for re play Diablo II which still amazing game. Last time I played this game in 16 years ago, I drop it in act III hell. Reason is power cut and I played for three hours without any save. After that, I had completed Hell with my Bonemancer. About writting, I published my first English article in Medium and become a writer for a publication.</p>
