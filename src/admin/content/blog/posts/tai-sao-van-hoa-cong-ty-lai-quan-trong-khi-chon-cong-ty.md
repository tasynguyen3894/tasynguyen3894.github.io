firstly, i gonna talk about background of my country. I come from Vietnam a Developing country. In my country, we have so many IT company from many countries in the world (Japanese, Chinese, Singapore, western contries...). Therefore, I had a chance to worked in many companies with many culture. I think beside technical, salary, benefit so culture of company (or employee) is very important when you decied join any company.
